Please note that we reserve the right to ask any delegates that are not adhering to these behaviours to leave the meeting.  

#### Acceptable behaviour

* Value the diversity of opinions and views that other conference participants have.
* Avoid personal attacks are other delegates, and only critique ideas rather than personal critiques.
* Request permission from the conference organiser and the speaker before recording video / audio presentations and discussions.
* Presenters may request that their presentation is not shared on social media, and all attendees must respect this.
* Being conscientious of ensuring that others have the opportunity to speak in group meetings.

#### Consequences  
Conference organisers and moderators will contact anyone not following the conference Code of Conduct. We reserve the right to remove any delegate from the meeting and prohibit attendance for future conferences.
