### <center>Science Communication</center>
Our ASAB 2025 Workshop will be focusing on *Science Communication*. We have teamed up with the **legendary** [Silverback Films](https://silverbackfilms.tv/) to develop a day full of all the nitty gritty details of scientific filmmaking, from both the creative and filmmaker perspective. We will be joined by Dr Tom Fletcher and Tom Land from Silverback, alongside LJMUâ€™s own Camilla Affleck (Liverpool Screen School) and Professor Peter Falkingham (*hint hint- prepare for dinosaurs*)

The workshop will be hosted on the **23rd of April** in LJMU's own [Student Life Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8DWsNPFvSQrHEdg97), located next to the historic Liverpool Lime Street Train Station. There will be lunch provided, and step free access throughout the day. Workshop attendence is included within *student* registration fees or as an optional extra for non-students- you won't want to miss it!
